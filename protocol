PROTOCOL

this is almost a carbon copy of every other tcp/ip protocol i write
don't care enough to make it fancy

packed values are msb

byte n is b.sub n

---

byte the zero: packet id
byte the one: region count
for 0 <= n < b.sub 1
    byte the byte after the last byte byte:
        region length < 128: one byte
        region length >= 128: two bytes, highest bit on msb always 1

byte the bytes after the header octet bytes:
    raw body data shoved next to each other with no separation
